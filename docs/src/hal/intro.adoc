== HAL Overview(((HAL)))

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (or with a reference to the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)[2001 Space Odyssey movie] just "HAL") is a software to 

* control the execution of other software and
* provide the infrastructure for the communication with and between the many software "threads" that it contols.

In itself, this link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware[Middleware] is agnostic about its application on CNC.
Searching for LinuxCNC use cases, the InterNet for instance knows about an astronomical application to control telescopes with LinuxCNC:
Motors move the telescope into the right position, and it needs to know how to map motor activity with the effect of that positioning with the real world.
Such a synchronisation of motor positions with real-world positions is reminiscent of what CNC machines need to do, or space crafts.
Any machine controller needs to know 

* about its internal state and how this maps to the environment (machine coordinates, state of switches/regulators), 
* how actuators are expected to change that state,
* allow for updates of the internal state by sensors (encoders, probes).

The adaptation to CNC for mills and lathes are implemented in adjunct parts of HAL (referred to as "components") that

* may know how to communicate with hardware,
* may be periodically executed
  - with a very high frequency of a few microseconds (Âµs) execution time, called base thread, e.g., to
    . give a stepper motor a trigger to step ahead, or to
    . read out the position presented by an encoder.
  - with a lower frequency every millisecond (ms), e.g. to
    . adjust the plannung for the next moves to complete a G-code instruction.
* are connected with each other, e.g., to update position data or have the planning algorithm tell the motors about the next step.

Taken together, HAL allows

. to program for a machine that the programmer does not know directly,
  but may rely on a programming interface with well-specified effect on the machine.
  That interface may be used to
  * tell the machine what to do
  * listen to what the machine wants to tell about the state it is in. 
. Vertical Abstractions: The human system integrator of such machine uses HAL
  * to describe what the machine is looking alike and how what cable controls what motor that drives what axis.
  * The description of the machine, the programmer's interfaces and the user's interface somehow "meet" in that abtract layer.
. Horizontal Abstractions:
  * Not all machines have all kinds of features
  * Mills, Lathes and Robots share many
    - features (motors, joints, ...),
    - planning algorithms for their movements.

HAL has no direct interaction with the user.
But multiple interfaces have been provided that allow HAL to be contacted

* from the command line, and it can be contacted
* from Python scripts and
* from within C/C++ programs,

but none of these interfaces are 'HAL itself'.
HAL is a program running in the background, a demon, which reads its configuration once and completely at startup to then remain in the background, answering to requests from users or machines alike.

However, other than for the typical service-oriented demon like a printer spooler or a web server,
at any given time, an individual machine can run no more than a single instance of HAL.
This is unfortunate, since today's hardware would be sufficient to control more than a single machine, but helps avoiding the need to check for conflicts and generally simplifies everything.
Virtualization could be a way to work around that one-HAL-per-machine-limitation,
but then special care needs to be taken that the extra latencies induced by the virtualization are compatible with the application.
With an increasing interest in the control of multiple cooperating machines, to overcome this limitation is likely one of the prime steps for the future development of HAL to address.
It is a bit tricky though and the community is still organizing its thoughts on this.

While the interpretation of G-code by the interpreter ("canon") may be part of LinuxCNC that is closest to a representation of the user's intent,
HAL is at the very technical center of LinuxCNC, that is used and/or extended by all the parts of LinuxCNC, which includes the GUIs.
The G-code interpreter knows how to interpret the G-code and translates it into machine operations by triggering signals in HAL.
Below is also shown how to learn about what is going on in a machine, i.e., how the user may ask HAL to report about its state, which then also represents the state of the machine.
While writing during the release days of version 2.9, the GUIs still make bit of an exception to that rule and may know something that HAL does not (need to) know.


== Communication

HAL is special in that it can communicate really fast

* with other programs, but in particular
* with its components that typically run in their very own thread.

And while communicating, the part of LinuxCNC that is talked to does not need to prepare for the communication:
All these actions are performed asynchroniously, i.e. no component is interrupting its regular execution to receive a signal and signals can be sent rightaway, i.e., an application may wait until a particular message has arrived - like an enable-signal, but it does not need to prepare for receiving that message.
This asynchronicity is beneficial for LinuxCNC at large, rendering it:

* *self-stabilizing*: A component not updating in time or an overloaded stepping motor missing a signal will see larger deltas to a previous position but will not be as close as possible to the latest state of the system.
  HAL offers PIDs that self-adjust a mismatch between an error and the strength of its correction. 
* *intrinsically parallel*: All components can be executed at the same time.
  HAL assigns components to different threads to juggle between components with
  * hard real-time demands, e.g., to keep motors ticking, and
  * tasks that need more time to compute, e.g., the path planning or user interfaces.

The communication system

* represents and controls all the hardware attached to the system,
* starts and stops other communicating programs.

The communication with the hardware of the machine itself is performed by respective dedicated HAL components.

The HAL-based communication system may be imagined as a black board via which all the many parts that constitute LinuxCNC are exchanging information.
That black board features pins that are identified by a name, though a LinuxCNC engineer may prefer the association with a pin of an electronic circuit.
These pins can have arbitrary values, i.e., beyond logics 0 and 1 also texts.
With HAL you can send a signal to that named pin.
Every part of HAL can read that pin that harbors that value of the signal.
That is until a new signal is sent to the same named pin to substitute the previous value.
The core message exchange system of HAL is agnostic about CNC, but HAL ships with a large number of components that know a lot about CNC and present that information via pins.
There are pins representing

* static information about the machine
* the current state of the machine
  - end switches
  - positions counted by steppers or as measured by encoders
* recipients for instructions
  - manual control of machine position ("jogging")
  - positions that stepper motors should take next

In a analogy to electronic cables, pins can be wired, so the value changing in one pin serves as input to another pin.
HAL components prepare such input and output pins and are thus automatically triggered to perform.

.HAL Components
The many "expert" software parts of LinuxCNC are typically implemented as _components_ of HAL, conceptually also referred to as _modules_.
These computer-implemented experts perpetually read from HAL about a state that the machine should strive to achieve
and compare that desired state with the state the machine is in at the very moment.
When there is a difference beween what shall be and what the current state is then some action is performed to reduce that difference,
while perpetually writing updates of the current states back to the HAL "black board system".

There are components specializing on how to talk to stepper motors, and other components know how to control servos.
On a higher level, some components know how the machine's axes are arranged in 3D and yet others know how to perform a smooth movement from one point in space to another.
Lathes, mills and robots will differ in the LinuxCNC component that are active, i.e. that are loaded by a HAL configuration file for that machine.
Still, two machines may be looking very different since built for very different purposes, but when they both use servo motors then they can still both use the same HAL servo component.

.From Where the Incentive to Move Originates
On the lowest (closest to hardware) level, e.g. for stepper motors, the description of a state of that motor is very intuitive:
It is the number of steps in a particular direction. 
A difference between the desired position and the actual position translates into a movement.
Speeds, acceleration and other parameters are all communicated and steadily updated via the HAL.

On the highest level, all motivation is derived from user-provided G-code.
That can be manually entered (referred to as MDI), crafted via a CAM tool (as provided by e.g. SolidWorks, Fusion360 or the Free software FreeCAD),
or (that is an exception) a special setup to e.g. cut gears has a script crafted in some programming language that generates G-code.
The latter would be not too different from programming a HAL component.

Any G-code line is interpreted and triggers a set of routines that in turn know how to communicate with components that are on a middle layer, e.g. to create a circle.

.Reuse of Components and New Developments
LinuxCNC provides a series of GUIs for lathes and mills in particular,
to visualize the states from various components and to change them manually, i.e. to control the the machine.
There is yet no such HAL GUI for rockets, but that is not a fault of the technology underneath HAL.
That said, there is an interest particularly in the 3D printing world to quantify vibration,
so we are expecting HAL components for gyroscopes any time soon.
With others working on fluid control, e.g. for biochemical research, a good fraction of controls required for rockets would be available.
A yet not existing HAL component would contribute the insights how gyros, fuel and height should work together and LinuxCNC would need additional GUIs to graphically present all those new parameters for the capcom.
HAL would then serve as "glue-logic", just in software, to lego-brick all those components together and direct them towards fulfilling their purpose.

.Pins and Signals
HAL has a special place in the heart of its programmers for the way that the data flow between modules is represented.
When traditional programmers think of variables, addresses or I/O ports, HAL refers to "pins".
And those pins are connected or assigned values to via signals.
Much like an electrical engineer would connect wires between pins of components of a mill, a HAL engineer establishes the data flow between pins of module instances.

The graphical user interface presents the pins together with their state, e.g., the state of an axis' limit switch may be represented graphically as an LED in the GUI.

The remainder of this introduction presents

* the syntax how pins of different components are connected in the HAL configuration files, and
* software of inspect the values of pins
  - at any given moment
  - developing over time

[[sec:hal-system-design]]
== HAL System Design(((HAL System Design)))

.HAL is based on traditional system design techniques.

HAL is based on the same principles that are used to design hardware circuits and systems, so it is useful to examine those principles first.
Any system, including a CNC(((CNC))) machine, consists of interconnected components.
For the CNC machine, those components might be the main controller, servo amps or stepper drives, motors, encoders,
limit switches, pushbutton pendants, perhaps a VFD for the spindle drive, a PLC to run a toolchanger, etc.
The machine builder must aselect, mount and wire these pieces together to make a complete system.

.HAL Concept - Connecting like electrical circuits.

Figure one would be written in HAL code like this:

[source,{hal}]

net signal-blue    component.0.pin1-in      component.1.pin1-out
net signal-red     component.0.pin3-out     component.1.pin3-in     component.1.pin4-in
----

[[sub:hal-part-selection]]
=== Part Selection(((HAL Part selection)))

The machine builder does not need to worry about how each individual part works.
He treats them as black boxes. During the design stage,
he decides which parts he is going to use - steppers or servos, which brand of servo amp, what kind of limit switches and how many, etc.
The integrator's decisions about which specific components to use is based on what that component does and the specifications supplied by the manufacturer of the device.
The size of a motor and the load it must drive will affect the choice of amplifier needed to run it.
The choice of amplifier may affect the kinds of feedback needed by the amp and the velocity or position signals that must be sent to the amp from a control.

In the HAL world, the integrator must decide what HAL components are needed.
Usually every interface card will require a driver.
Additional components may be needed for software generation of step pulses, PLC functionality, and a wide variety of other tasks.

[[sub:hal-interconnections-design]]
=== Interconnection Design(((HAL: Interconnections Design)))

The designer of a hardware system not only selects the parts, he also decides how those parts will be interconnected.
Each black box has terminals, perhaps only two for a simple switch, or dozens for a servo drive or PLC.  They need to be wired together.
The motors connect to the servo amps, the limit switches connect to the controller, and so on.
As the machine builder works on the design, he creates a large wiring diagram that shows how all the parts should be interconnected.

When using HAL, components are interconnected by signals.
The designer must decide which signals are needed, and what they should connect.

[[sub:hal-implementation]]
=== Implementation(((HAL: Implementation)))

Once the wiring diagram is complete it is time to build the machine.
The pieces need to be acquired and mounted, and then they are interconnected according to the wiring diagram.
In a physical system, each interconnection is a piece of wire that needs to be cut and connected to the appropriate terminals.

HAL provides a number of tools to help 'build' a HAL system.
Some of the tools allow you to 'connect' (or disconnect) a single 'wire'.
Other tools allow you to save a complete list of all the parts, wires, and other information about the system, so that it can be 'rebuilt' with a single command.

[[sub:hal-testing]]
=== Testing(((HAL: Testing)))

Very few machines work right the first time.
While testing, the builder may use a meter to see whether a limit switch is working or to measure the DC voltage going to a servo motor.
He may hook up an oscilloscope to check the tuning of a drive, or to look for electrical noise.
He may find a problem that requires the wiring diagram to be changed;
perhaps a part needs to be connected differently or replaced with something completely different.

HAL provides the software equivalents of a voltmeter, oscilloscope, signal generator, and other tools needed for testing and tuning a system.
The same commands used to build the system can be used to make changes as needed.

[[sub:hal-basics]]
=== Summary(((HAL Basics Summary)))

This document is aimed at people who already know how to do this kind of hardware system integration, but who do not know how to connect the hardware to LinuxCNC.
See the <<sec:halui-remote-start,Remote Start Example>> section in the HAL UI Examples documentation.

.Remote Start Example (Schema)
image::images/remote-start.png["Remote Start Example (Schema)"]

The traditional hardware design as described above ends at the edge of the main control.
Outside the control are a bunch of relatively simple boxes, connected together to do whatever is needed.
Inside, the control is a big mystery -- one huge black box that we hope works.

HAL extends this traditional hardware design method to the inside of the big black box.
It makes device drivers and even some internal part of the controller into smaller black boxes that can be interconnected and even replaced just like the external hardware.
It allows the 'system wiring diagram' to show part of the internal controller, rather than just a big black box.
And most importantly, it allows the integrator to test and modify the controller using the same methods he would use on the rest of the hardware.

Terms like motors, amps, and encoders are familiar to most machine integrators.
When we talk about using extra flexible eight conductor shielded cable to connect an encoder to the servo input board in the computer,
the reader immediately understands what it is and is led to the question, 'what kinds of connectors will I need to make up each end.'
The same sort of thinking is essential for the HAL but the specific train of thought may take a bit to get on track.
Using HAL words may seem a bit strange at first, but the concept of working from one connection to the next is the same.

This idea of extending the wiring diagram to the inside of the controller is what HAL is all about.
If you are comfortable with the idea of interconnecting hardware black boxes, you will probably have little trouble using HAL to interconnect software black boxes.

[[sec:hal-concepts]]
== HAL Concepts(((HAL Concepts)))

This section is a glossary that defines key HAL terms but it is a bit different than a traditional glossary because these terms are not arranged in alphabetical order.
They are arranged by their relationship or flow in the HAL way of things.

Component:: (((HAL Component)))
  When we talked about hardware design, we referred to the individual pieces as 'parts', 'building blocks', 'black boxes', etc.
  The HAL equivalent is a 'component' or 'HAL component'.
  This document uses 'HAL component' when there is likely to be confusion with other kinds of components, but normally just uses 'component'.
  A HAL component is a piece of software with well-defined inputs, outputs, and behavior, that can be installed and interconnected as needed.
   +
   +
  Many HAL Components model the behaviour of a tangible part of a machine,
  and a *pin* may indeed be meant to be connected to a *physical pin* on the device to communicate with it, hence the names.
  But most often this is not the case.
  Imagine a retrofit of a manual lathe/mill.
  What LinuxCNC implements is how the machine presents itself to the outside world,
  and it is secondary if the implementation how to draw a circle is implemented on the machine already or provided from LinuxCNC.
  And it is common to add buttons to the imaginary retrofit that *signal* an action, like an emergency stop.
  LinuxCNC and the machine become one. And that is through the HAL.

Parameter:: (((HAL Parameter)))
  Many hardware components have adjustments that are not connected to any other components but still need to be accessed.
  For example, servo amps often have trim pots to allow for tuning adjustments, and test points where a meter or scope can be attached to view the tuning results.
  HAL components also can have such items, which are referred to as 'parameters'.
  There are two types of parameters:
  Input parameters are equivalent to trim pots - they are values that can be adjusted by the user, and remain fixed once they are set.
  Output parameters cannot be adjusted by the user - they are equivalent to test points that allow internal signals to be monitored.

Pin:: (((HAL Pin)))
  Hardware components have terminals which are used to interconnect them.
  The HAL equivalent is a 'pin' or 'HAL pin'.
  'HAL pin' is used when needed to avoid confusion.
  All HAL pins are named, and the pin names are used when interconnecting them.
  HAL pins are software entities that exist only inside the computer.

Physical_Pin:: (((HAL Physical Pin)))
  Many I/O devices have real physical pins or
  terminals that connect to external hardware, for example the pins of a
  parallel port connector. To avoid confusion, these are referred to as
  'physical pins'. These are the things that 'stick out' into the real
  world.

[NOTE]
====
You may be wondering what relationship there is between the HAL_pins,
Physical_pins and external elements like encoders or a STG card: we are
dealing here with interfaces of data translation/conversion type.
====

Signal:: (((HAL Signal)))
  In a physical machine, the terminals of real hardware components are interconnected by wires.
  The HAL equivalent of a wire is a 'signal' or 'HAL signal'. 
  HAL signals connect HAL pins together as required by the machine builder.
  HAL signals can be disconnected and reconnected at will (even while the machine is running).

Type:: (((HAL Type)))
  When using real hardware, you would not connect a 24 Volt relay output to the +/-10&#8239;V analog input of a servo amp.
  HAL pins have the same restrictions, which are based upon their type.
  Both pins and signals have types, and signals can only be connected to pins of ffvthe same type.
  Currently there are 4 types, as follows:
+
- bit - a single TRUE/FALSE or ON/OFF value
- float - a 64 bit floating point value, with approximately 53 bits of
  resolution and over 1000 bits of dynamic range.
- u32 - a 32 bit unsigned integer, legal values are 0 to 4,294,967,295
- s32 - a 32 bit signed integer, legal values are -2,147,483,647 to
  +2,147,483,647

Function:: (((HAL:Function)))
  Real hardware components tend to act immediately on their inputs.
  For example, if the input voltage to a servo amp changes, the output also changes automatically.
  However software components cannot act 'automatically'.
  Each component has specific code that must be executed to do whatever that component is supposed to do.
  In some cases, that code simply runs as part of the component.
  However in most cases, especially in realtime components, the code must run in a specific sequence and at specific intervals.
  For example, inputs should be read before calculations are performed on the input data,
  and outputs should not be written until the calculations are done.
  In these cases, the code is made available to the system in the form of one or more 'functions'.
  Each function is a block of code that performs a specific action.
  The system integrator can use 'threads' to schedule a series of functions to be executed in a particular order and at specific time intervals.

Thread:: (((HAL:Thread)))
  . 'thread' is a list of functions that runs at specific intervals as part of a realtime task.
  When a thread is kirst created, it has a specific time interval (period), but no functions.
  Functions can be added to the thread, and will be executed in order every time the thread runs.

As an example, suppose we have a parport component named hal_parport.
That component defines one or more HAL pins for each physical pin.
The pins are described in that component's doc section:
Their names, how each pin relates to the physical pin, are they inverted, can you change polarity, etc.
But that alone doesn't get the data from the HAL pins to the physical pins.
It takes code to do that, and that is where functions come into the picture.
The parport component needs at least two functions:
One to read the physical input pins and update the HAL pins, the other to take data from the HAL pins and write it to the physical output pins.
Both of these functions are part of the parport driver.

[[sec:hal-components]]
== HAL components(((HAL Components)))

Each HAL component is a piece of software with well-defined inputs, outputs, and behavior, that can be installed and interconnected as needed.
The section <<sec:hal-components,HAL Components List>> lists all available components and a brief description of what each does.

[[sec:hal-timing-issues]]
== Timing Issues In HAL(((HAL Timing Issues)))

Unlike the physical wiring models between black boxes that we have said that HAL is based upon,
simply connecting two pins with a HAL-signal falls far short of the action of the physical case.

True relay logic consists of relays connected together, and when a contact opens or closes, current flows (or stops) immediately.
Other coils may change state, etc., and it all just 'happens'.
But in PLC style ladder logic, it doesn't work that way.
Usually in a single pass through the ladder, each rung is evaluated in the order in which it appears, and only once per pass.
A perfect example is a single rung ladder, with a NC contact in series with a coil.
The contact and coil belong to the same relay.

If this were a conventional relay, as soon as the coil is energized, the contacts begin to open and de-energize it.
That means the contacts close again, etc, etc.
The relay becomes a buzzer.

With a PLC, if the coil is OFF and the contact is closed when the PLC begins to evaluate the rung, then when it finishes that pass, the coil is ON.
The fact that turning on the coil opens the contact feeding it is ignored until the next pass.
On the next pass, the PLC sees that the contact is open, and de-energizes the coil.
So the relay still switches rapidly between on and off, but at a rate determined by how often the PLC evaluates the rung.

In HAL, the function is the code that evaluates the rung(s).
In fact, the HAL-aware realtime version of ClassicLadder exports a function to do exactly that.
Meanwhile, a thread is the thing that runs the function at specific time intervals.
Just like you can choose to have a PLC evaluate all its rungs every 10&#8239;ms, or every second, you can define HAL threads with different periods.

What distinguishes one thread from another is 'not' what the thread does - that is determined by which functions are connected to it.
The real distinction is simply how often a thread runs.

In LinuxCNC you might have a 50âÂµs thread and a 1âms thread.
These would be created based on BASE_PERIOD and SERVO_PERIOD, the actual times depend on the values in your INI file.

The next step is to decide what each thread needs to do.
Some of those decisions are the same in (nearly) any LinuxCNC system.
For instance, motion-command-handler is always added to servo-thread.

Other connections would be made by the integrator.
These might include hooking the STG driver's encoder read and DAC write functions to the servo thread,
or hooking StepGen's function to the base-thread, along with the parport function(s) to write the steps to the port.
